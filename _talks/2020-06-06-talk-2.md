During the [MIDL2020](https://2020.midl.io), I and [Anna Kuzina](https://akuzina.github.io) presented our work on transfer learning for 3D MRI segmentation. How to learn deep and big 3D UNet-like model with only 5 or 10 training images? It is a common question for medical data. We address it by imposing prior distribution over the convolutional kernels as the generative model (VAE)!

Thanks to the MIDL, here it is the [page with video, slides and short paper](https://2020.midl.io/papers/kuzina20.html). If you are interested, there is published [full paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00844/full). If you decide to try this approach or develop it, we published the [code](https://akuzina.github.io/DWP/).

Abstract of the paper:

Automatic segmentation methods based on deep learning have recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the ordinary methods. Nevertheless, these methods are inapplicable for small datasets, which are very common in medical problems. To this end, we propose a knowledge transfer method between diseases via the Generative Bayesian Prior network. Our approach is compared to a pre-train approach and random initialization and obtains the best results in terms of Dice Similarity Coefficient metric for the small subsets of the Brain Tumor Segmentation 2018 database (BRATS2018).
