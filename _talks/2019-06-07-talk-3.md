I presented our (Evgenii Egorov, Kirill Neklydov, Ruslan Kostoev and Evgeny Burnaev) work on greedy semi-parametric Variational Inference. We propose a version of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm with entropy regularization in the density space. There are [slides](boosting/ISNN_Boosting.pdf) and [full-text](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07855) on arXiv, as well as [published version](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-22796-8_43).

Abstract of the paper:

One of the core problems in variational inference is a choice of approximate posterior distribution. It is crucial to trade-off between efficient inference with simple families as mean-field models and accuracy of inference. We propose a variant of a greedy approximation of the posterior distribution with tractable base learners. Using Max-Entropy approach, we obtain a well-defined optimization problem. We demonstrate the ability of the method to capture complex multimodal posterior via continual learning setting for neural networks.
