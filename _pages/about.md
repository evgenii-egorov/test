I am working in the field of deep learning and machine learning.

My current research focuses on approximate probabilistic inference. Iâ€™m interested in the following research areas and methods:

- Geometric measure theory, MCMC, PDE and Symmetries.
- Information geometry, variational inference, (Bayesian) deep learning.

See my [publications](https://scholar.google.ru/citations?user=LwVVunEAAAAJ). I am happy to collaborate or give a talk. 


Also, I did apply projects for Sberbank, Huawei and Gazprom. I can do this for your company too!
